Scene I. A shadowy place, maybe a cavern.  A rain of fire.
  Enter three witches.

1 Witch
    When shall we three meet again
    In fiery storms, or in rain?

2 Witch
    When the halligalli's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

3 Witch
    That will be ere the set of the sun.

1 Witch
    Where the place?
