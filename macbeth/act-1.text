Scene I. A shadowy place, maybe a cavern.  A rain of fire.
  Enter four witches.

1 Witch
    When shall we four meet again
    In fiery storms, or in rain?

2 Witch
    When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

3 Witch
    That will be ere the set of the sun.

4 Witch
    Where the place?

1 Witch
    Upon the heth.

2 Witch
    There to meet with Macbeth.
